# CONTRIBUTING
This is TBD. Please feel free to propose ideas to flesh this out.

## BRANCHES
The repo has three primary branches. The top level is "master", which both the "hardware" and "software" branches feed into. All feature branches should feed into either the hardware or software branches, and one of the project managers will merge those two branches into master on a periodic basis.

- Hardware: This branch is for all MCAD and ECAD related items.
- Software: This branch is for all software related items.

## MCAD:
- [ ] Model is in SolidWorks 2019 format
- [ ] Design intent and requirements have been met
- [ ] Design has been fit checked to ensure no interferences exist
- [ ] Design has been integrated into Next Higher Assembly (NHA)

## PCB/ECAD:
- [ ] Requirements definition captured
- [ ] Schematic created
- [ ] Netlist created
- [ ] PCB Routed
- [ ] PCB constrained by physical footprint limitations
- [ ] PCB critical component location requirements met
- [ ] All ECAD shall be conducted in KiCAD 5 using the standard KiCAD libraries and the custom library available within the GrabCAD repository.
- [ ] PCB designs shall be delivered with a schematic, layout, BOM and fully defined 3D STEP model.
- [ ] Production/Prototype ready boards shall be delivered with Gerber files for the board shops.
- [ ] The overall PCB design shall consider cost as a main factor, where possible use software fixes to hardware problems (button debounce, signal propagation times, etc).
- [ ] All PCBs shall be designed with ease of assembly and reusability in mind.
- [ ] When possible similar pieces shall be panelized in order to reduce fabrication costs.
- [ ] Each schematic where multiple options are provided shall be provided with a userâ€™s guide in order to facilitate assembly.
- [ ] The power requirements for each board shall be calculated and provided as part of the documentation.
- [ ] Router configured as: Shove, with remove redundant tracks, automatic neckdown, amooth dragged segments enabled.
- [ ] DRM configured as required.
- [ ] Gerbers generated IAW Wiki Procedure

## Software:
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules
